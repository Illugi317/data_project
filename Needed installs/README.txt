Needed installs for *Name WIP* Python/sql db/webserver project currently. (03.04.2017 - Helgi St)

:- Python version 3.4.x
:- Mysql connector 2.1.5 for python 3.4
AKA all the installers in this folder.

Python 3.4 HAS to be installed BEFORE Mysql connector !!!

If you are using Pycharm to edit remember to change the interpreter to python 3.4, 
The project (.idea) should be set configured to select it automatically but it doesn't hurt to check it just in case.
